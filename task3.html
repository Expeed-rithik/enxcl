   <center><h1>UEFA Champions League</h1></center> 
   <p>The UEFA Champions League is an annual club football competition organized by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and features the top football clubs from Europe.

<h2>Here are some key points about the UEFA Champions League:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Format:</li> The tournament typically begins with a group stage, where clubs are divided into groups and play against each other in a round-robin format. The top teams from each group advance to the knockout stage, which consists of rounds of two-legged knockout ties until the final.

<li>History:</li> The UEFA Champions League was established in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup and was rebranded as the UEFA Champions League in 1992. Real Madrid is the most successful club in the history of the competition, having won the title multiple times.

<li>Recent Champions:</li> In recent years, clubs like Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Liverpool have been dominant in the Champions League. The most recent champions, as of 2021, were Chelsea FC, who defeated Manchester City in the final.

<li>Global Audience:</li> The UEFA Champions League attracts a massive global audience, with millions of fans tuning in to watch the matches on television and online streaming platforms.

<li>Prize:</li> Apart from the prestige of winning the tournament, the winning club also earns a substantial financial reward and qualifies for the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.

For the most recent information on the UEFA Champions League, including match schedules, standings, and results, I recommend checking the official UEFA website or reputable sports news outlets.

    <p>Ten Hag's team had to end Bayern's tournament record 39-game unbeaten run in the group stages and still hope for a draw between Copenhagen and Galatasaray to take the runner-up spot.

    But United barely troubled a Bayern team that had already been assured of top spot in the group and a place in the knockout stage for the 16th straight season.
    
    "We had our moments but just didn't take them," Ten Hag said.</p>

   <p> United's prospects weren't helped when, shortly before halftime, Maguire was substituted because of an apparent groin injury. Jonny Evans replaced the England international.
    
    Another defender, Shaw, was then substituted at the break, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka coming on in his place.</p>

   <p>Bayern had created the better chances in the first half, with Leroy Sane the visitors' biggest threat. But he got technique all wrong with an attempted side-foot volley from close range that failed to hit the target.
    
    United's best opportunity came through Shaw's shot that was punched over by Manuel Neuer.</p>
